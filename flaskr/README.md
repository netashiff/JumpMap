# **JumpMap**
***

## Welcome! Please read through this README to understand how to get JumpMap running.
&nbsp;
**Important Note: MongoDB should already be installed and must have the following to work:**
- A database named, **JumpMap** (case sensitive)
- Initial collection named, **admin** (not case sensitive)
#
This is because the program is using localhost versus having the website run off a server (this a project for a college course).
